      "question": "What Is Sound?",
      "answer": "How we sense changes in Atmospheric Pressure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do we hear when we hear a sting vibrate?",
      "answer": "The air molecules moving around - back and forth."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Compression?",
      "answer": "A peak of high pressure.  When the string of a musical instrument pushes air molecules to create sound. "
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Rarefaction?",
      "answer": "A trough of low pressure.  When the string of a musical instrument pulls air molecules to create sound. "
    },
    {
      "question": "What is created when there is a repetition of compression and rarefaction?",
      "answer": "A longitudinal wave. "
    },
    {
      "question": "How Can We Visualize Sound Waves?",
      "answer": "Plot change in air pressure against time. "
    },
    {
      "question": "Name two key aspects of sound?",
      "answer": "Amplitude and Frequency "
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Amplitude?",
      "answer": "The strength of the wave. "
    },
    {
      "question": "What Is RMS?",
      "answer": "Root Mean Square - helps determine the average amplitude of a single. "
    },
    {
      "question": "What Is Frequency?",
      "answer": "How many cycles of peaks and troughs in a second. "
    },
    {
      "question": "How (unit of measure) is frequency measured?",
      "answer": "RMS "
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Pitch?",
      "answer": "How we perceive a change in frequency. "
    },
    {
      "question": "Pitch rises as what rises? ",
      "answer": "frequency "
    },
    {
      "question": "What does phase mean? ",
      "answer": "Audio waveforms are cyclical; that is, they proceed through regular cycles or repetitions. Phase is defined as how far along its cycle a given waveform is. The measurement of phase is given in degrees, with 360 degrees being one complete cycle. "
