    {
      "question": "What do we hear when we hear a sting vibrate?",
      "answer": "The air molecules moving around - back and forth."

      "question": "What is Compression?",
      "answer": "A peak of high pressure.  When the string of a musical instrument pushes air molecules to create sound. "
